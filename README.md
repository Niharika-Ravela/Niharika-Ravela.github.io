## Internships and Voluntary Work
**Voluntary Intern @ dSilo.ai (_November 2023 - Present_)**
- Product Mapping: Wrote Python scripts to match and map products across different datasets, ensuring consistency in product identification and categorization.
- Vendor Unification: Implemented fuzzy matching algorithms in Python to unify vendor names or identifiers across datasets, achieving a threshold similarity score of 90%.
- Extracting Bounding Coordinates from JSON Files:Developed Python code to extract bounding coordinates from JSON files, enabling precise localization of items within documents or images.
- Master Data Management:Led master data management efforts, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of invoice and vendor data assets across the organization.
- PDF Content Extraction and Enhancement: Utilized OCR techniques to extract text from scanned PDF documents, enhancing readability and searchability by overlaying the extracted text onto the original PDF files.
- Conducted data analysis to compare existing suppliers with those lacking contracts, identifying discrepancies and opportunities for contract management improvement.
- Blackstone Data Validations Framework and Outlier Detection:Implemented the design phase of data validations framework, performing comprehensive data validations on invoices and developing outlier detection models to identify unusual transactions based on historical data.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
