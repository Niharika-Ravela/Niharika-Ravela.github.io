## Internships and Voluntary Work
**Voluntary Intern @ dSilo.ai (_November 2023 - Present_)**
- Product Mapping: Wrote Python scripts to match and map products across different datasets, ensuring consistency in product identification and categorization.
- Vendor Unification: Implemented fuzzy matching algorithms in Python to unify vendor names or identifiers across datasets, achieving a threshold similarity score of 90%.
- Extracting Bounding Coordinates from JSON Files:Developed Python code to extract bounding coordinates from JSON files, enabling precise localization of items within documents or images.
- Master Data Management:Led master data management efforts, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of invoice and vendor data assets across the organization.
- PDF Content Extraction and Enhancement: Utilized OCR techniques to extract text from scanned PDF documents, enhancing readability and searchability by overlaying the extracted text onto the original PDF files.
- Conducted data analysis to compare existing suppliers with those lacking contracts, identifying discrepancies and opportunities for contract management improvement.
- Blackstone Data Validations Framework and Outlier Detection:Implemented the design phase of data validations framework, performing comprehensive data validations on invoices and developing outlier detection models to identify unusual transactions based on historical data.

**Data Science Intern @ AppsTek Corp (_February 2021 - December 2021_)**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:Employed Python and Pandas to clean and preprocess raw datasets, handling missing values and outliers.
- Utilized SQL for data manipulation tasks, including joining multiple tables and filtering rows.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as histograms and scatter plots.
- Leveraged Tableau for interactive visualizations to identify patterns and trends in the data.
- Generated interactive dashboards and reports using Tableau to present findings and insights.
- Used Python libraries like NumPy and SciPy to calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation. Conducted hypothesis testing to make inferences about population parameters.
- Built machine learning models using Python libraries like Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- Evaluated model performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score to assess predictive capabilities.

The Harry Potter Movie Script Dashboard, created with Tableau and Python, provides analysis of the Harry Potter film series. It visualizes dialogue distribution, character prominence, popular locations, and spell usage. The data, sourced from movie scripts, underwent cleaning and preparation before being visualized. Insights include dialogue peaks, longest runtime, frequent spells, and popular locations, providing a comprehensive overview. Recommendations emphasize compelling dialogue, exploring new spells, and featuring iconic locations to enhance the enchanting experience.
